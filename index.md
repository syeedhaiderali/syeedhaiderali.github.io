UNIVERSITY PROJECTS
Vertical Take-Off & Landing Aircraft (VTOL) [Final Year Project]
Accomplished the Take-Off & Landing on our real aircraft model in a controlled environment
Worked on test benches of Pitch and Roll models of VTOL
Kalman Filter was used to estimating the angles from the redundant data of sensors
PID controller was used for the stabilization 
Python-based GUI was also created to control the aircraft & visualize its movements

Replicating Human Fingers Synergies Onto Robotic Hands 
Robotic Hand was programmed to replicate human fingers synergies
Fingers’ movement of the human hand was feedbacked by flex sensors to the controller
XBee was used for the wireless transmission of feedback data
Robotic Arm Controlling Based On Human Hand Gestures [For self-interest]
A Robotic Arm with six degrees of freedom was used and controlled by human hand gestures
Orientation of human hand was measured through inertial measurement unit (IMU)
Control messages were sent to the Robotic Arm via electrical wire
Soccer Robot
A Robot chassis with Omni wheels was purchased
Circuit designing and firmware development was done so the robot can play Soccer
Bluetooth module was used for wireless communication
The movement of the robot was controlled through 3rd party android application using Bluetooth
Bluetooth Controlled Robotic Car
Circuit designing and firmware development was done in the project
Robot Movement was controlled with the 3rd party android application using Bluetooth
Line Following Robot 
LFR was created to navigate on the predefined paths 
Discrete electronic components were used for circuit designing
Formation Control Of Multi-Robots With Real-Time Mapping On Python Based GUI [For self-interest]
This project was concerned with planning the motion of mobile robots in Leader-Follower Formation
Five robotic cars’ chassis were used to make different formations
Python Based GUI was created to visualize path and to send commands to Leader Robot 
XBees were used for wireless communication
Screen Cursor Controlling Through Facial Gestures Using MATLAB [For self-interest]
Controlled display screen mouse cursor using face gestures
Detection and tracking of the face were achieved using the Viola-Jones and KLT algorithms respectively 
The 'Robot' java class used to simulate events
Design & Implementation Of Vehicular Wireless Ad Hoc Network (WANET) Using XBee [For self-interest]
Prototype boards were created to allow vehicles to communicate with each other & reduce unwanted accidents
XBee was used to create a mesh network and LCD modules were used to visualize data
Electronic Notices Board With Wireless Update Via XBee [For self-interest]
Electronic Notice Board was designed to advertise schedules of each LAB at SSUET
TFT screen was used for advertisement
Advertisement data can be updated using serial port or XBee

Digital Clock & Stopwatch
Designed digital clock and stopwatch simulations on proteus
